	OBJECTIVE
The objective behind this 3756/4814 collaboration project is to develop scouting software to complement a 
hybrid paper/electronic scouting system, to be released to the public when it is fully developed.

	SCOUTING STRUCTURE
The scouting structure works like this: scouts use "Bubble Sheets", filling in the bubbles to count stats 
for a robot in a match. After each match, the sheets are then scanned into a folder on a scouting laptop. 
The scouting software is then run, using vision recognition to extract the data from the sheet. The data 
is then saved to a CSV file, where Microsoft Excel can be used to manipulate the data in whatever way the 
scouting team desires.

	SOFTWARE
The software has two functions. To map a template bubble sheet and to extract data from the scouting sheets.
